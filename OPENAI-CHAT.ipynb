    "This Python script uses OpenAI's API to build a chatbot capable of generating text-based responses. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Environment Setup**:\n",
    "   - **`load_dotenv()`**: This function loads environment variables from a `.env` file, specifically the API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), which is required to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`generate_openai_text()` Function**:\n",
    "   - This function interacts with OpenAI's API to generate text using a conversation-based format.\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `api_key`: API key for OpenAI.\n",
    "     - `model`: Specifies which OpenAI model to use (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o`).\n",
    "     - `messages`: A list of conversation messages in the format required by OpenAI.\n",
    "     - `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`: Control various aspects of text generation like randomness, output length, diversity, word repetition, and new topics.\n",
    "   - **Response Handling**:\n",
    "     - Sends a POST request to OpenAI's `chat/completions` endpoint.\n",
    "     - Returns the API's JSON response or `None` if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`ChatBot` Class**:\n",
    "   - This class encapsulates the chatbot's behavior and manages conversation flow with OpenAI's API.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Initialization (`__init__`)**:\n",
    "     - Initializes the chatbot with parameters like API key, model choice (`gpt-4o`), temperature, and conversation history.\n",
    "     - Allows customization of OpenAI API settings for more fine-tuned control of text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`add_message()` Method**:\n",
    "     - Adds a message to the conversation history. This maintains the context of the chat by keeping track of both user and assistant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`get_response()` Method**:\n",
    "     - Takes the user's input and adds it to the conversation history.\n",
    "     - Calls the `generate_openai_text()` function to get a response from OpenAI.\n",
    "     - The assistant's reply is added to the conversation history and returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Main Program**:\n",
    "   - A **`ChatBot`** instance is created using the API key.\n",
    "   - The bot is tasked with responding to the user input: \"Can you suggest 5 dinner ideas for this week?\"\n",
    "   - The chatbot calls `get_response()` to generate a reply, which is then printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "The chatbot maintains the context of the conversation and provides interactive dialogue with the user. In this case, the bot suggests five dinner ideas when asked, but it could be used for various conversational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows for flexible, dynamic conversations, powered by OpenAI’s language models, with customizable parameters like response creativity and length."

      "- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons olive oil\n",
      "- Juice of 2 lemons\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dried rosemary)\n",
      "- Salt and black pepper to taste\n",
      "\n",
      "**For the Roasted Vegetables:**\n",
      "- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, halved\n",
      "- 3 large carrots, sliced\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
      "- Salt and black pepper to taste\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Marinate the Chicken:**\n",
      "   - In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.\n",
      "   - Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well-coated.\n",
      "   - Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for better flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Preheat the Oven:**\n",
      "   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Prepare the Vegetables:**\n",
      "   - In a large bowl, toss the halved Brussels sprouts and sliced carrots with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n",
      "   - Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Cooking:**\n",
      "   - Place the marinated chicken breasts on a separate baking sheet or oven-safe dish.\n",
      "   - Put both the chicken and the vegetables in the preheated oven.\n",
      "   - Roast the vegetables for about 25-30 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized, stirring halfway through.\n",
      "   - Bake the chicken for about 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the juices run clear. You can also use a meat thermometer to check for doneness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Optional Step:**\n",
      "   - If you wish, drizzle the roasted vegetables with a little balsamic vinegar for added flavor once they come out of the oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Serve:**\n",
      "   - Arrange the chicken breasts and roasted vegetables on plates.\n",
      "   - Garnish with extra fresh herbs or lemon slices if desired.\n",
